# Fullstack Developer Evaluation Exercise

## Project: Task Management Application

### Overview
The goal of this exercise is to evaluate your skills in fullstack development, including backend, frontend, database design, and best practices in coding, security, and scalability. You are free to choose the technology stack that you are most comfortable with. (We prefer springboot for the backend if is possible)

### Task Description
Build a basic Task Management Application that allows users to register, log in, and manage their tasks. The application should support the following functionalities:

### Functional Requirements

1. **User Registration and Login:**
   - Allow users to register with email and password.
   - Implement login functionality with validation.

2. **Task Management:**
   - Create a new task with a title, description, and due date.
   - Edit existing tasks.
   - Mark tasks as completed or pending.
   - Delete tasks.
   - List all tasks for the logged-in user.
   - Filter tasks by status (completed, pending).
   - Search tasks by title or description.

3. **User Interface:**
   - Develop a basic responsive web interface to interact with the application.
   - Display success and error messages for user actions.

4. **API:**
   - Implement a RESTful API for managing users and tasks.
   - Secure endpoints to ensure that users can only manage their own data.

5. **Security:**
   - Implement basic security practices such as password hashing.
   - Protect API routes with authentication and authorization mechanisms.

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Documentation:**
   - Provide API documentation (e.g., Swagger or a README section).
   - Include instructions for running the application locally.

2. **Git Usage:**
   - Maintain a clear and descriptive commit history.
   - Use branches for features and merge them into the main branch with proper commit messages.

3. **Error Handling:**
   - Implement basic error handling for common cases (e.g., invalid input, unauthorized access).
   - Return meaningful error messages in the API responses.

4. **Testing:**
   - Write basic unit tests for core functionalities (e.g., user registration, task creation).
   - Ensure that the most critical parts of your application are covered.

### Exercise Details

- **Estimated Time to Complete:** 1-2 days (maximum 8 hours).
- **Submission:** Upload your project to a private repository on GitHub or GitLab and provide access to the evaluator.
- **Documentation:** Include a README file with setup instructions and a brief description of your solution.

### Optional (Bonus Points)
- Implement a feature to sort tasks by due date.
- Add a priority field to tasks (e.g., Low, Medium, High) and allow filtering by priority.
- Implement additional security measures like JWT-based authentication or OAuth.

### Final Notes
The goal is not to complete everything perfectly but to showcase your understanding of fullstack development, your coding practices, and your problem-solving approach. Focus on creating a functional and well-documented application.
